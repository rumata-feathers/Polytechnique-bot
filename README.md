This is a simple ordering bot written to take orders for the Student Organisation campaign (students can order food, specifically crÃªpes from the student group). 

It supported features, like sending images, evaluating and taking orders. One the user has chosen the order, it's reformated and send to the groupchat with those, who will make and deliver the order. One the order is taken (reacted in chat), it is sent to the one who will be responsible for it.
